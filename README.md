# didigen: Dialect Dictionary Generator

didigen will be a template that anyone can download and use to turn their data into a database of translation equivalents - a dictionary. It is currently in development, being built alongside [DSW](https://dsw.dustah.com), a German-Swiss German online dictionary.

It will be fully open-source, forever.
